Auto Derpifier
---


This is just some crappy python from https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/ adjusted to try to auto add derp emoji eyes to a picture. It tries to detect a face with a haar cascade, then find eyes within that face.  For each eye it tries to randomly rotate the googley eye and then merges the images together.
